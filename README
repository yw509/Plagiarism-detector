Plagiarism Detector

Overview:
Our project is aiming to detect the plagiarism between two files which will print out the similar percentage between two files. If the similarity between two files is bigger than 80%, the plagiarism is detected. Otherwise, we will not treat it as a plagiarism behavior. 

How to run?
We implement this project by c
Command: $ ./plagiarism test1.txt test2.txt

Sample:
$ ./plagiarism try1.txt try2.txt
The similarity between these two files is: 28.43%
$ ./plagiarism test1.txt test2.txt
The similarity between these two files is: 98.94%
Plagiarism detected.

We divided our project into three main parts:
Part1: CLEANUP
	Remove punctuations of the input files.
	Convert words into lower cases.

Part2: TF-IDF
	Get the frequency of each word.
	Decide the importance of each word based on the value of TF-IDF.
	Delete the words that are important such as "a, the, of, ...".

Part3: COSSIM-SIMILARITY
	Get the similarity between two files based on cos = (A * B) / (|A| * |B|)
