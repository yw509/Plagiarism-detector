Plagiarism Detector

Overview:
Our Plagiarism Detector is aiming to detect the plagiarism between two files then print out the similar percentage between two files. If the similarity between two files is bigger than 80%, the plagiarism is detected. Otherwise, we will not treat it as a plagiarism behavior. 
Our Plagiarism Detector works on text files such as essays, computer source code files, and other assignments in digital form.

How do I compile it?
If using Unix or Linux, just type "make". 
If using Windows, consult your compiler's documentation. You simply need to compile the plagiarism.c source code file into an executable called plagiarism (plagiarism.exe for Windows users).

How do I use it?
Plagiarism Detector is a command-line program. That is, you run it from an xterm or DOS window. It isn't graphical, and has no graphical user interface. Sorry. 
Use it like this:
Command: $ ./plagiarism <file1> <file2>

What does the output look like?
Sample:
$ ./plagiarism try1.txt try2.txt
The similarity between these two files is: 28.43%
$ ./plagiarism test1.c test2.c
The similarity between these two files is: 98.94%
Plagiarism detected.

(0% means no similarity and 100% means there is a very high chance of a lot of similarity. 100% does not mean that the files are exactly the same, since the program randomly throws away some data in order to perform a faster match.)
(Usually, a percentage over 80 will be treated as plagiarism behavior.)

We divided our Plagiarism Detector into four main parts:
Part1: CLEANUP
	Remove punctuations of the input files.
	Convert words into lower cases.

Part2: TF-IDF
	Get the frequency of each word.
	Decide the importance of each word based on the value of TF-IDF.
	Delete the words that are important such as "a, the, of, ...".

Part3: COSSIM-SIMILARITY
	Get the similarity between two files based on cos = (A * B) / (|A| * |B|)

Part4: PLAGIARISM
	Integrate the preceding three parts

Limitations:
1.Our program fails to detect plagiarism if the article is a paraphrased version of the other.
2.Our program only compares and print outs the percentage of literal similarity between two articles, so percentage over 80% may not necessarily indicates plagiarism in some situations.
